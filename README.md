# 👋 Hey there! I'm Sivaram

**📊 Bridging the gap between business and data**

After 3 years in sales, I realized what I loved most wasn’t just hitting targets — it was figuring out *why* the numbers moved the way they did. That curiosity led me into data analytics, and I've been hooked ever since.

Now I’m diving deep into tools like Python, R, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and Excel — and this repo is where I’m building and sharing projects along the way. Think of it as my digital notebook + proof of what I can do.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills I’m Exploring
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook)
- R (ggplot2, dplyr, tidyverse)
- SQL (data exploration, reporting)
- Tableau
- Power BI
- Excel (yeah, I still love a good pivot table)

## 🔍 Why This Repo Exists
To track my growth, showcase what I’m building, and hopefully connect with people who nerd out about data as much as I do.
